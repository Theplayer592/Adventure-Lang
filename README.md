# Setup
## Mac & Linux
To setup run the following commands:
  
    cd <directory>
    chmod +x ./util/setup.sh
    ./util/setup.sh

## Windows
To setup run the following commands (in command prompt, **NOT** powershell):

    cd <directory>
    "./util/setup.bat"

That should then setup and run the application. Any further testing will only require you to run the `npm test` command.
